<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

### Flutter `master` channel

The Flutter Gallery targets Flutter's `master` channel. As such, it can take advantage
of new SDK features that haven't landed in the stable channel.

If you'd like to run the Flutter Gallery, you may have to switch to the `master` channel
first:

```bash
flutter channel master
flutter upgrade
```

When you're done, use this command to return to the safety of the `stable`
channel:

```bash
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
```
